# Photo Manager

This script will rename all photos in a directory 
to have the same naming scheme based on the time that 
the photos were taken.

This allows users to combine photos taken on
different devices and maintain a time series 
ordering of files in a directory (when files 
are ordered by file name).

## Dependencies:
* Python
* [ExifTool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
